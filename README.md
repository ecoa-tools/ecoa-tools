Hi,

We are in charge to provide Open Source Tools around ECOA (European Component Oriented Architecture).
They have been developped on behalf of the French MoD (DGA - Direction Générale de l'Armement).

Our goal is to push solutions that can be used on lab desktops and that can help to understand the
ECOA technology or to provide lightweight and low cost development platforms.

You may reach us through this project. We are open to any feedback or tool enhancement proposal.

Enjoy

The ECOA Tools Team
